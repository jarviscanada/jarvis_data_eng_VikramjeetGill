# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: My name is Vikramjeet Gill. I am a recent graduate of York University and I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am a software developer here at Jarvis and during this role I have honed several key technical skills by working on projects both for internal use and client projects. In this role I have used Java, PostgreSQL, bash scripting, and various other technologies. Before working at Jarvis I worked for a nonprofit called Software For Love mostly doing front-end work designing websites for clients including charities where I applied my knowledge of front-end technologies and frameworks like React and Bootstrap to build the user interfaces of the client websites. Before that, I was working as a student success mentor lead at York where I was responsible for managing our Peer Helper program and leading a team of over 30 people. What excites me the most about the software development industry is the opportunity to work on software solutions that will have a direct positive impact on people's lives. Software solutions have been at the forefront of revolutionizing finance, transportation, healthcare, and many other sectors and so as a software developer you can be assured that your work is having an impact and changing people's lives for the better.
