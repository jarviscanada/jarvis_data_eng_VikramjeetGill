  "summary": "My name is Vikramjeet Gill. I am a recent graduate of York University and I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am a software developer here at Jarvis. Before working at Jarvis I worked for a nonprofit called Software For Love mostly doing front-end work designing websites for clients including charities. Before that, I was working as a student success mentor lead at York where I was responsible for managing our Peer Helper program and leading a team of over 30 people. What excites me most about the software development industry is the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects in many industries. Businesses in every sector of the economy require software developers so as a developer you have the option of working for whatever sector you want ranging from banking to big tech to gaming to aerospace to E-commerce and more."
